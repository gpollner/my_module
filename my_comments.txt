Suggested improvements:

- Change the config form route's permission to a more restrictive one like 'access administration pages' or create custom permissions and assign them to the proper roles.
- Create a link to the configuration page inside an administrative menu.
- Allow customizing each instance of the ExampleBlock by adding its own blockAccess method and its blockForm with corresponding validat and submit methods.
- Define a configuration schema so that the module's configuration can be exported/imported.
- Refator ExampleBlock code so that it uses dependency injection instead of calling stating methods. 
- Add validation to the bundle field in configuration to make sure the bundle type exists or change the field type to a dropdown list containing only existing bundles.
- Create a help page for the module.
- Move the block's markup to a template file. 
- To prevent error in Drupal 9 change the line 31 from ExampleBlock.php.
Replace this:
 $storage = \Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage('node');
With this:
 $storage = \Drupal::entityTypeManager()->getStorage('node');
